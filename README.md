# ipld-plugin-experiments

Just familiarizing myself with the go-ipfs plugin system.

Packages:

* merkle: a quickly hacked ipld plugin that uses a simple merkle tree (instead of a dag) to store leaves.

**NOTE 1:** Plugins only work on Linux and MacOS at the moment. You can track the progress of this issue here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19282

## Building and Installing

You can *build* the example plugin by running `make build`. You can then install it into your local IPFS repo by running `make install`.

Plugins need to be built against the correct version of go-ipfs. This package generally tracks the latest go-ipfs release but if you need to build against a different version, please set the `IPFS_VERSION` environment variable.

You can set `IPFS_VERSION` to:

* `vX.Y.Z` to build against that version of IPFS.
* `$commit` or `$branch` to build against a specific go-ipfs commit or branch.
   * Note: if building against a commit or branch make sure to build that commit/branch using the -trimpath flag. For example getting the binary via `go get -trimpath github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs@COMMIT`
* `/absolute/path/to/source` to build against a specific go-ipfs checkout.

To update the go-ipfs, run:

```bash
> make go.mod IPFS_VERSION=version
```
